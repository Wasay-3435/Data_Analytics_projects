🏦 Banking Data Analysis Project

Power BI | Python | SQL | Excel | Data Visualization
This project analyzes a banking dataset with 3,000 clients and 25 columns, focusing on understanding customer demographics, financial behavior, income levels, deposits, loans, and risk classifications.
The goal was to transform raw banking data into a clear, interactive, and insight-rich Power BI dashboard.
