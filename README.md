Healthcare Provider Analytics – Power BI Dashboard
📊 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built using a healthcare provider dataset.
The goal of the dashboard is to analyze key metrics related to patient visits, diagnoses, procedures, providers, and insurance usage. The insights help stakeholders understand healthcare service performance, patient trends, and operational bottlenecks.

The dataset consists of multiple CSV files, including:

visits.csv

patients.csv

providers.csv

procedures.csv

diagnoses.csv

departments.csv

cities.csv

insurance.csv

Each file contains structured information that collectively enables a holistic view of healthcare operations.

🎯 Objectives

To visualize healthcare provider performance and patient interactions.

To understand visit volume trends across cities, departments, and time.

To analyze diagnoses and procedure distributions.

To study patient demographics and insurance company contributions.

To enable data-driven decision-making for hospital or clinic management.

🗂 Dataset Description
File	Description
visits.csv	Records of patient visits including date, provider, department, and associated codes.
patients.csv	Demographic information such as age, gender, and patient identifiers.
providers.csv	Details of healthcare providers (physicians, specialists, etc.).
diagnoses.csv	Diagnosis codes and descriptions logged during patient visits.
procedures.csv	Medical procedures performed and their categorization.
departments.csv	Hospital or clinic departments.
cities.csv	Geographical information related to patient or provider locations.
insurance.csv	Details of insurance companies and patient coverage.
